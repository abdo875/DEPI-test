1- merge conflict and how to solve it
2- merge types:
        1- three-ways
        2- fast forward
    # fast forward merge

                 HEAD
                  ||
           A- B - C
>    new Branch       \ X - Y -> merge

    #three-ways
                 HEAD                                merge commit
                  ||                                  |
           A- B - C - M - N   #  A- B - C - M - N -X -Y
>   new Branch       \ X - Y -> merge

               m-commit
                 | 
main A - Z - B - X
    \B
    

Rebase 
               H 
               |
      A - B - C          X  merge make x and change head to x but rebase take pointe and make it in M
              \ K - L - M



-> merge Vs Rebase     merge -> safe history    rebase -> clear history change pointer only



workflow
    1- release flow
    2- git flow
